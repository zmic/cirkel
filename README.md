#### CIRKEL

Disclaimer: I wrote this code in a hurry during a two week period in 2014, for quick experimentation. It was never refactored or cleaned up as it should be. It works, and it's not inscrutable, but does NOT meet my professional standards for deliverable source code.

### How to install it

On Windows:
`pip install cirkel`

OR

clone this repository, build the binary with Visual Studio 2017/2019 and run setup.py

### How to  use it

See example.py
